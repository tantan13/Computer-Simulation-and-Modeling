    "Suppose we wish to model the crowd flocking and evacuation behaviour in a population distributed with the above three basic rules. Each individual boid must move in the same direction as its closest neighbors, meaning that the model exhibits a 'follow the leader' sort of behaviour. The second rule is to not stray off by oneself, meaning the flock of boids must move in a group, combining this with the first rule gives a flock that always faces the same direction. The third rule is to not be to close as to avoid collision with other boids. These are the main things addressed in part 1.\n",

It is neccessary for the implementation of the align rule, which causes boids that are part of the same flock to have the same general direction. For every flockmate within the alignment range, a boid will feel a force to match its heading to that of the flockmate. If there are multiple flockmates in the alignment range, the boid tries to move towards the average direction of those flockmates.

Once the boids pass each other, they no longer \"see\" each other, so the turning stops.\n",
