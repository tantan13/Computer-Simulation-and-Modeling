# PeachTreeSims

# Running Code
Event-oriented Queueing Model:
To run this model, use the python 2.7 model using “module load python\2.7” and then running the simulationengine.py file in Event_Oriented_Jas directory of the base GitHub directory.

Cellular Automata:
To run this model, use the python 3.6 model using “module load python\3.6” and then running the CellularAutomata.py file from the github base directory. The output tells you when lights change where 0 is green and 1 is red. The output also tells you the car number (based on when it arrived in the model) and the time it took to traverse the whole corridor. The model does not currently have a stopping point, but it can be keyboard interrupted whenever necessary.

Activity Scanning Event Oriented:
To run this model, use the python 2.7 model using "module load python\2.7" and then running the simulationengine.py file from the ActivityScanningTan directory of the github directory. Included are csv outputs for making graphs.
